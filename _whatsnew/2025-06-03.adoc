=== Notification service support
Workload factory now supports sending notifications to the BlueXP alerts service or to an Amazon SNS topic. Notifications sent to BlueXP alerts appear in the BlueXP alerts panel. When workload factory publishes notifications to an Amazon SNS topic, subscribers to the topic (such as people or other applications) receive the notifications at the endpoints configured for the topic (such as email or SMS messages).

=== Updated permissions terminology
The workload factory user interface and documentation now use "Read-only" to refer to read permissions and "Read-Write" to refer to automate permissions.

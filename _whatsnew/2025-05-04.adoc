=== CloudShell autocomplete support
When using BlueXP workload factory CloudShell, you can start typing a command and press the Tab key to view available options. If multiple possibilities exist, the CLI will display a list of suggestions. This feature enhances productivity by minimizing errors and speeding up command execution.

=== Updated permissions terminology
The workload factory user interface and documentation now use "read-only" to refer to read permissions and "read/write" to refer to automate permissions.

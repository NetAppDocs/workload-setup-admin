[.lead]
You can create and manage links to provide a trust relationship and connectivity between a Workload Factory account and one or more FSx for ONTAP file systems. This enables you to monitor and manage certain features directly from the FSx for ONTAP file system that are not available through the AWS FSx for ONTAP API. 

See link:connectivity-links.html[Connectivity links] for details about when a link is and is not needed.

.About this task

Links leverage AWS Lambda to execute code in response to events and automatically manage the computing resources required by that code. The links that you create are part of your NetApp account and they are associated with an AWS account.

You can create a link in your account when defining an FSx for ONTAP file system. That link will be used for that file system, and it can be used by other FSx for ONTAP file systems.

You'll need to launch an AWS CloudFormation stack in your AWS account to create the link.

.Prerequisites

* You'll need to have credentials to log in to your AWS account.
* You'll need to have the following permissions in your AWS account when adding a link using a CloudFormation stack:

.Steps

. Select *Associate link* from the FSx for ONTAP wizard.

. Select *Create a new link* and select *Continue*.

. Enter the name that you want to use for this link. The name must be unique within your account.

. Optionally, add any tags that you want to be associated with this link so you can more easily categorize your resources. For example, you could add a tag that identifies this link as being used by FSx for ONTAP file systems.
+
The AWS account and the additional information for Account, Location, and Security group are retrieved automatically based on the FSx for ONTAP file system.

. Select *Redirect to CloudFormation*.
+
A dialog that explains how to create the link from the AWS CloudFormation service is displayed.

. Select *Continue* to open the AWS Management Console, and then log in to the AWS account for this FSx for ONTAP file system.

. On the Quick create stack page, under Capabilities, select *I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources*.
+
Note that three permissions are granted to Lambda when you launch the CloudFormation template. Workload Factory uses these permissions when using links.
+
[source,json]
"lambda:InvokeFunction",
"lambda:GetFunction",
"lambda:UpdateFunctionCode"

. Select *Create stack* and then select *Continue*.
+
You can monitor the link creation status from the Events page. This should take no more than 5 minutes.

. Return to the Workload Factory interface and you'll see that the link is associated with the FSx for ONTAP file system.

.Result

The link you created is associated with the FSx for ONTAP file system and you can perform some advanced ONTAP operations.

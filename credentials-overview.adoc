Learn how Workload Factory uses AWS credentials to perform actions on your behalf. Understanding these details can be helpful as you manage the credentials for one or more AWS accounts in Workload Factory. For example, you might want to learn about when to add additional AWS credentials to Workload Factory.

We have designed an AWS assume role credentials registration flow that: 

* Supports a more aligned AWS account permissions by allowing you to specify the workload capabilities you want to use and providing IAM policy requirements according to selection  
* Allowing you to adjust the granted AWS account permissions as you opt-in or opt-out of specific workload capabilities. 
* Simplifies manual IAM policy creation by providing tailored policy JSON files that can be applied in AWS console 
Further simplify credentials registration process by offering users with an automated option for required   IAM policy and role creation using AWS CloudFormation stacks  
Align better with FSX for ONTAP users who strongly prefer to have their credentials stored within the boundaries of the AWS cloud ecosystem by allowing storage of the FSxN services credentials  in an AWS based  secret management backend
This Epic handles the first phase of this proposed enhancement which is add support for a manual registration flow that allows  per service granularity for FSX for ONTAP workload services. 



== Initial AWS credentials

When you deploy a Connector from BlueXP, you need to provide the ARN of an IAM role or access keys for an IAM user. The authentication method that you use must have the required permissions to deploy the Connector instance in AWS. The required permissions are listed in the link:task-install-connector-aws-bluexp.html#step-2-set-up-aws-permissions[Connector deployment policy for AWS].

When BlueXP launches the Connector instance in AWS, it creates an IAM role and an instance profile for the instance. It also attaches a policy that provides the Connector with permissions to manage resources and processes within that AWS account. link:reference-permissions-aws.html[Review how BlueXP uses the permissions].

If you create a new working environment for Cloud Volumes ONTAP, BlueXP selects these AWS credentials by default:

image:screenshot_accounts_select_aws.gif[A screenshot that shows the Switch Account option in the Details & Credentials page.]

You can deploy all of your Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems using the initial AWS credentials, or you can add additional credentials.

== Additional AWS credentials

There are two ways to add additional AWS credentials:

* You can add AWS credentials to an existing Connector
* You can add AWS credentials directly to BlueXP

Review the sections below for more details.

=== Add AWS credentials to an existing Connector

If you want to use BlueXP with additional AWS accounts, then you can either provide AWS keys for an IAM user or the ARN of a role in a trusted account. The following image shows two additional accounts, one providing permissions through an IAM role in a trusted account and another through the AWS keys of an IAM user:

image:diagram_permissions_multiple_aws.png["A conceptual image that shows two additional accounts. Each has an IAM policy, one is attached to IAM user and the other is attached to an IAM role."]

You would then add the account credentials to BlueXP by specifying the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role, or the AWS keys for the IAM user.

For example, you can switch between credentials when creating a new Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment:

=== Add AWS credentials directly to BlueXP

Adding new AWS credentials to BlueXP provides the permissions needed to create and manage an FSx for ONTAP working environment or to create a Connector.

* link:task-adding-aws-accounts.html#add-additional-credentials-to-a-connector[Learn how to add AWS credentials to BlueXP for creating a Connector]

== Credentials and marketplace subscriptions

The credentials that you add to a Connector must be associated with an AWS Marketplace subscription so that you can pay for Cloud Volumes ONTAP at an hourly rate (PAYGO) or through an annual contract, and to use other BlueXP services. 

link:task-adding-aws-accounts.html#subscribe[Learn how to associate an AWS subscription].

Note the following about AWS credentials and marketplace subscriptions:

* You can associate only one AWS Marketplace subscription with a set of AWS credentials
* You can replace an existing marketplace subscription with a new subscription

== FAQ

The following questions are related to credentials and subscriptions.

=== How can I securely rotate my AWS credentials?

As described in the sections above, BlueXP enables you to provide AWS credentials in a few ways: an IAM role associated with the Connector instance, by assuming an IAM role in a trusted account, or by providing AWS access keys.

With the first two options, BlueXP uses the AWS Security Token Service to obtain temporary credentials that rotate constantly. This process is the best practice--it's automatic and it's secure.

If you provide BlueXP with AWS access keys, you should rotate the keys by updating them in BlueXP at a regular interval. This is a completely manual process.

=== Can I change the AWS Marketplace subscription for Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environments?

Yes, you can. When you change the AWS Marketplace subscription that's associated with a set of credentials, all existing and new Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environments will be charged against the new subscription.

link:task-adding-aws-accounts.html#subscribe[Learn how to associate an AWS subscription].

=== Can I add multiple AWS credentials, each with different marketplace subscriptions?

All AWS credentials that belong to the same AWS account will be associated with the same AWS Marketplace subscription.

If you have multiple AWS credentials that belong to different AWS accounts, then those credentials can be associated with the same AWS Marketplace subscription or with different subscriptions.

=== Can I move existing Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environments to a different AWS account?

No, it's not possible to move the AWS resources associated with your Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment to a different AWS account.

=== How do credentials work for marketplace deployments and on-prem deployments?

The sections above describe the recommended deployment method for the Connector, which is from BlueXP. You can also deploy a Connector in AWS from the AWS Marketplace and you can manually install the Connector software on your own Linux host.

If you use the Marketplace, permissions are provided in the same way. You just need to manually create and set up the IAM role, and then provide permissions for any additional accounts.

For on-premises deployments, you can't set up an IAM role for the BlueXP system, but you can provide permissions using AWS access keys.

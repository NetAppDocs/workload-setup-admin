[.lead]
Open CloudShell to execute AWS or ONTAP CLI commands from anywhere in the NetApp Workload Factory console.

== About this task
CloudShell allows you to execute AWS CLI commands or ONTAP CLI commands in a shell-like environment from within the Workload Factory console. It simulates terminal sessions in the browser, providing terminal features and proxying messages through Workload Factory's backend. It allows you to use the AWS credentials and ONTAP credentials that you have provided in your NetApp account.

CloudShell features include: 

* Multiple CloudShell sessions: deploy multiple CloudShell sessions at one time to issue several sequences of commands in parallel, 
* Multiple views: split CloudShell tab sessions so you can view two or more tabs horizontally or vertically at the same time
* Session renaming: rename sessions as needed
* Last session content persistence: re-open the last session if you close it by mistake
* Settings preferences: change the font size and output type
* AI-generated error responses for ONTAP CLI commands
* Autocomplete support: start typing a command and use the *Tab* key to view available options

== CloudShell commands
Within the CloudShell GUI interface, you can enter `help` to view available CloudShell commands. After you issue the `help` command, the following reference appears. 

.Description
NetApp CloudShell is a GUI interface built into NetApp Workload Factory enables you to execute AWS CLI commands or ONTAP CLI commands in a shell-like environment. It simulates terminal sessions in the browser, providing terminal features and proxying messages through the backend in Workload Factory. It enables you to use the AWS credentials and ONTAP credentials that you have provided in your NetApp account.
 
.Available commands
 
* `clear`
* `help`
* `[--fsx <fsxId>] <ontap-command> [parameters]`
* `aws <aws-command> <aws-sub-command> [parameters]`
 
.Context

Each terminal session runs in a specific context: credentials, region, and optionally FSx for ONTAP file system.
+ 
All AWS commands execute in the provided context. AWS commands will only succeed if the provided credentials have permissions in the specified region.
+ 
You can specify ONTAP commands with an optional `fsxId`. If you provide an `fsxId` with an individual ONTAP command, then this ID overrides the ID in the context. If the terminal session doesn't have an FSx for ONTAP file system ID context, then you must provide `fsxId` with each ONTAP command.
+ 
To update different context specifics, do the following:
* To change credentials: "using credentials <credentialId>"
* To change region: "using region <regionCode>"
* To change FSx for ONTAP file system: "using fsx <fileSystemId>"
 
.Showing Items

* To show available credentials: "show credentials"
* To show available regions: "show regions"
* To show command history: "show history"
 
.Variables
The following are examples of setting and using variables. If a variable value contains spaces, you should set it inside quotes.
+
* To set a variable: $<variable> = <value>
* To use a variable: $<variable>
* Example setting a variable: $svm1 = svm123
* Example using a variable: --fsx FileSystem-1 volumes show --vserver $svm1
* Example setting a variable with string value $comment1 = "A comment with spaces"
 
.Operators
 
Shell operators such as pipe `|`, background execution `&`, and redirection `>` aren't supported. Command execution fails if you include these operators.

== Before you begin
CloudShell works in the context of your AWS credentials. To use CloudShell, you must provide at least one AWS credential.

NOTE: CloudShell is available for you to execute any AWS or ONTAP CLI command. However, if you want to work within the context of an FSx for ONTAP file system, make sure you issue the following command: `using fsx <file-system-name>`.

== Deploy CloudShell
You can deploy CloudShell from anywhere in the NetApp Workload Factory console. You can also deploy CloudShell from the NetApp Console.

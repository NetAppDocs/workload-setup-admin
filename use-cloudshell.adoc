[.lead]
Open CloudShell to execute AWS or ONTAP CLI commands from anywhere in the BlueXP workload factory user interface.

== About this task
CloudShell allows you to execute AWS CLI commands or ONTAP CLI commands in a shell-like environment from within the BlueXP workload factory user interface. It simulates terminal sessions in the browser, providing terminal features and proxying messages through workload factory's backend. It allows you to use the AWS credentials and ONTAP credentials that you have provided in your BlueXP account.

CloudShell features include: 

* Multiple CloudShell sessions: deploy multiple CloudShell sessions at one time to issue several sequences of commands in parallel, 
* Multiple views: split CloudShell tab sessions so you can view two or more tabs horizontally or vertically at the same time
* Session renaming: rename sessions as needed
* Last session content persistence: re-open the last session if you close it by mistake
* Settings preferences: change the font size and output type


== Before you begin
CloudShell works in the context of your AWS credentials. To use CloudShell, you must provide at least one AWS credential.

NOTE: CloudShell is available for you to execute any AWS or ONTAP CLI command. However, if you want to work within the context of an FSx for ONTAP file system, make sure you issue the following command: `using fsx <file-system-name>`.

== Deploy CloudShell
You can deploy CloudShell from anywhere in the BlueXP workload factory console. You can also deploy CloudShell from Storage from within an FSx for ONTAP file system.

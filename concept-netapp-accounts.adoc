A Workload Factory account provides multi-tenancy for your organization, which enables you to organize users, resources, and workload access using credentials.

When you first access Workload Factory, you're prompted to select or create an account. For example, you'll see the following screen if you don't have an account yet:

Workload Factory Account Admins can then modify the settings for this account by managing users (members), workspaces, and Connectors:

== Deployment modes

Workload Factory offers the following deployment modes for your account: standard mode, restricted mode, and private mode. These modes support environments that have varying levels of security and connectivity restrictions.

== Members

Members are Workload Factory users that you associate with your Workload Factory account. Associating a user with an account and one or more workspaces in that account enables those users to create and manage working environments in Workload Factory.

When you associate a user, you assign them a role:

* _Account Admin_: Can perform any action in Workload Factory.
* _Workspace Admin_: Can create and manage resources in the assigned workspace.
* _Compliance Viewer_: Can only view compliance information for Workload Factory classification and generate reports for workspaces that they have permission to access.

== Workspaces

In Workload Factory, a workspace isolates any number of _working environments_ from other users in the account. Workspace Admins can't access the working environments in a workspace unless the Account Admin associates the admin with that workspace.

A working environment represents a storage system. For example:

* A Cloud Volumes ONTAP system
* An on-premises ONTAP cluster
* A Kubernetes cluster

== Connectors

A Connector executes the actions that Workload Factory needs to perform in order to manage your data infrastructure. The Connector runs on a virtual machine instance that you deploy in your cloud provider or on an on-premises host that you configured.

You can use a Connector with more than one Workload Factory service. For example, if you're using a Connector to manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP, you can use that same Connector with another service like Workload Factory tiering.

== Examples

The following examples depict how you might set up your accounts.

NOTE: In both example images that follow, the Connector and the Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems don't actually reside _in_ the Workload Factory account--they're running in a cloud provider. This is a conceptual representation of the relationship between each component.

=== Multiple workspaces

The following example shows an account that uses two workspaces to create isolated environments. The first workspace is for a production environment and the second is for a dev environment.

=== Multiple accounts

Here's another example that shows the highest level of multi-tenancy by using two separate Workload Factory accounts. For example, a service provider might use Workload Factory in one account to provide services for their customers, while using another account to provide disaster recovery for one of their business units.

Note that account 2 includes two separate Connectors. This might happen if you have systems in separate regions or in separate cloud providers.

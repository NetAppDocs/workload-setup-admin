summary: Workload Factory provides a storage calculator so you can compare the costs of storage on FSx for ONTAP file systems against Elastic Block Store (EBS), Elastic File Systems (EFS), and FSx for Windows File Server. Depending on your storage requirements, you might find that FSx for ONTAP file systems are the most cost effective for you.

Workload Factory provides a storage calculator so you can compare the costs of storage on FSx for ONTAP file systems against Elastic Block Store (EBS), Elastic File Systems (EFS), and FSx for Windows File Server. Depending on your storage requirements, you might find that FSx for ONTAP file systems are the most cost effective for you.

The criteria that is compared between the different types of storage systems includes the total required capacity and the total performance -- required IOPS and required throughput.

== Provide your system requirements

If you have enabled _automate_ mode (link:operational-modes.html[learn more about modes]) by adding AWS credentials to your Workload Factory account, then Workload Factory is able to identify all the the storage systems that are available in your AWS account and display the characteristics of the volumes on those systems in the Storage inventory page. The AWS account that is searched is based on the credentials you've defined in your Workload Factory account.
//add _read_ mode above when it is supported

This figure shows the volumes on FSx for Windows File Server systems that have been discovered in your AWS account.

If you haven't added credentials to link your Workload Factory account with an AWS account (called _basic_ mode), you can manually enter the characteristics required for a storage system you are planning to deploy and the storage calculator will determine the best file system based on cost.

This figure shows the storage calculator page with a comparison between FSx for ONTAP and Elastic Block Store storage.

== Use the storage calculator

When you click the *Explore savings* button and follow the wizard, the storage calculator displays whether the storage for the workloads on these storage systems would cost less if you used an FSx for ONTAP file system.

You can also select specific volumes from this page and then click *Explore savings* to compare only those selected volumes.

If Workload Factory determines that you could save money by running these workloads on an FSx for ONTAP file system, you can deploy the file system from the calculator directly from Workload Factory. In some cases, Workload Factory may recommend that you deploy multiple file systems based on the amount of storage you are currently using, and based on the performance characteristics of your workloads. 

== Deploy FSx for ONTAP file systems

Based on the requirements you entered, or that have been discovered from your existing storage systems in AWS, the FSx creation wizard is pre-populated with your required characteristics, such as required capacity, AWS region, required IOPS, and required throughput. You will need to enter values for some fields before you can create a new FSx for ONTAP file system. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-fsx-ontap/learn-fsx-ontap.html[Learn more about creating FSx for ONTAP file systems.]

If you are using _automate_ mode where Workload Factory has assumed an AWS role that has full permissions to deploy FSx for ONTAP file systems, you can deploy the system directly from Workload Factory. You can also copy the content from the Codebox window and deploy the system using one of the Codebox methods.

If you are using _basic_ mode where Workload Factory has no linked AWS credentials, you'll need to copy the content from the Codebox window and deploy the system using one of the Codebox methods.

== What to do next

After you create your new FSx for ONTAP file systems, you can migrate your data to the volumes on those systems.

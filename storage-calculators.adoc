Workload Factory provides a storage calculator so you can compare the costs of storage on FSx for ONTAP file systems against Elastic Block Store (EBS), Elastic File Systems (EFS), and FSx for Windows File Server. Depending on your storage requirements, you might find that FSx for ONTAP file systems are the most cost effective for you.

Workload Factory is able to identify all the the storage systems that are available in your AWS account and display the characteristics of the volumes on those systems. The AWS account that is searched is based on the credentials you've defined in your Workload Factory accounts.

The criteria that is compared on these volumes includes the total capacity, required IOPS, and required throughput.

This figure shows the volumes on FSx for Windows File Server systems that have been discovered in your AWS account.

You can click the *Explore savings* button and follow the wizard to display whether the storage for the workloads on these storage systems would cost less if you used an FSx for ONTAP file system.

You can also select specific volumes from this page and then click *Explore savings* to compare only those selected volumes.

If Workload Factory determines that you could save money by running these workloads on an FSx for ONTAP file system, you can click *Create* to deploy an FSx for ONTAP file system from the calculator. In some cases Workload Factory may recommend that you deploy multiple file systems based on the amount of storage you are currently using, and based on the characteristics of your workloads. Afterwards you can migrate your data to the new storage system.

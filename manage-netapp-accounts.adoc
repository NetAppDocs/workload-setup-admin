== Manage your account with the Tenancy API

If you want to manage your account settings by sending API requests, then you'll need to use the _Tenancy_ API.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-automation/tenancy/overview.html[View endpoints for the Tenancy API^]

== Create and manage service accounts

A service account acts as a "user" that can make authorized API calls to Workload Factory for automation purposes. This makes it easier to manage automation because you don't need to build automation scripts based on a real person's user account who can leave the company at any time.

You give permissions to a service account by assigning it a role, just like any other Workload Factory user. You can also associate the service account with specific workspaces in order to control the working environments (resources) that the service can access.

When you create the service account, Workload Factory enables you to copy or download a client ID and client secret for the service account. This key pair is used for authentication with Workload Factory.

Note that a refresh token is not required for API operations when using a service account. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-automation/platform/grant_types.html[Learn about refresh tokens^]

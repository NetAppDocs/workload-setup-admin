When you create a Workload Factory account, it only includes a single admin user. You can manage the account to fit your organization's needs by adding users, creating service accounts for automation purposes, and more.

== Manage your account with the Tenancy API

If you want to manage your account settings by sending API requests, then you'll need to use the _Tenancy_ API. This API is different than the BlueXP API, which you use to create and manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environments.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-automation/tenancy/overview.html[View endpoints for the Tenancy API^]

== Create and manage users

The user's in your account can access and manage the resources in specific workspaces.

=== Add users

Associate users with your BlueXP account so those users can create and manage working environments in BlueXP.

.Steps

. If the user hasn't already done so, ask the user to go to https://workload.netapp.com/[NetApp Workload Factory website^] and sign up.

. From the top of Workload Factory, select the *Account* drop-down.

. From the Members tab, select *Associate User*.

. Enter the user's email address and select a role for the user:
+
* *Account Admin*: Can perform any action in Workload Factory.
* something else?.

. Select *Associate*.

.Result

The user should receive an email from NetApp Workload Factory titled "Account Association." The email includes the information needed to access BlueXP.

=== Remove users

Disassociating a user makes it so they can no longer access the resources in a Workload Factory account.

. Select *Disassociate User* and select *Disassociate* to confirm.

.Result

The user can no longer access the resources in this BlueXP account.

== Create and manage service accounts

A service account acts as a "user" that can make authorized API calls to Workload Factory for automation purposes. This makes it easier to manage automation because you don't need to build automation scripts based on a real person's user account who can leave the company at any time.

You give permissions to a service account by assigning it a role, just like any other Workload Factory user. You can also associate the service account with specific workspaces in order to control the working environments (resources) that the service can access.

When you create the service account, Workload Factory enables you to copy or download a client ID and client secret for the service account. This key pair is used for authentication with Workload Factory.

Note that a refresh token is not required for API operations when using a service account. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-automation/platform/grant_types.html[Learn about refresh tokens^]

=== Create a service account

Create as many service accounts as you need to manage the resources in your working environments.

.Steps

. From the top of BlueXP, select the *Account* drop-down.
+
image:screenshot-account-settings-menu.png[A screenshot that shows the Account Settings option in the top banner of BlueXP.]

. Select *Manage Account* next to the currently selected account.
+
image:screenshot-manage-account-settings.png[A screenshot that shows the Manage Account Settings option that's available from the Account drop-down.]

. From the Members tab, select *Create Service Account*.

. Enter a name and select a role. If you chose a role other than Account Admin, choose the workspace to associate with this service account.

. Select *Create*.

. Copy or download the client ID and client secret.
+
The client secret is visible only once and is not stored anywhere by BlueXP. Copy or download the secret and store it safely.

. Select *Close*.

=== Obtain a bearer token for a service account

In order to make API calls to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-automation/tenancy/overview.html[Tenancy API^], you'll need to obtain a bearer token for a service account.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-automation/platform/create_service_token.html[Learn how to create a service account token^]

== Allow private previews

Services in private preview are not guaranteed to behave as expected and might sustain outages and be missing functionality.

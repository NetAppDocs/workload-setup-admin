Get started with Workload Factory by preparing networking for the Workload Factory console, signing up and creating an account, optionally creating a connection link, and subscribing to Workload Factory.

Workload Factory is accessible to users as a cloud service from the web-based console. Before you get started, you should have an understanding of link:workload-factory-accounts.html[Workload Factory accounts], link:connectivity-links.html[connectivity links], and link:operational-modes.html[operational modes].

Computers that access the Workload Factory console should have connections to specific endpoints to complete a few administrative tasks. If your network restricts outbound access, you should ensure that these endpoints are allowed.

Go to the https://console.workload.netapp.com[Workload Factory console^] and sign up. You'll be given the option to create an account, but you can skip that step if you're being invited to an existing account.

At this point, you're logged in and can start using several Workload Factory capabilities, such as creating Amazon FSx for ONTAP file systems, deploying databases on FSx for ONTAP systems, and migrating virtual machine configurations in on-premises vSphere environments VMware Cloud on AWS using FSx for ONTAP file systems as external datastores.

You don't need to use a link to get started with Workload Factory, but you can create a link to unlock all Workload Factory features and capabilities. A link creates trust relationship and connectivity between Workload Factory and an AWS account. Links currently leverage AWS Lambda.

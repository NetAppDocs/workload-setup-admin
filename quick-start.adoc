Get started with Workload Factory by preparing networking for the Workload Factory console, signing up and creating an account, and adding credentials so that Workload Factory can manage AWS resources directly.

Workload Factory is accessible to users as a cloud service from the web-based console. Before you get started, you should have an understanding of link:workload-factory-accounts.html[Workload Factory accounts], link:operational-modes.html[operational modes], and link:connectivity-links.html[connectivity links].

Computers that access the Workload Factory console should have connections to specific endpoints to complete a few administrative tasks. If your network restricts outbound access, you should ensure that these endpoints are allowed.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
This step is optional. You can use Workload Factory in _Basic_ mode without adding credentials to access your AWS account. Adding AWS credentials to Workload Factory in either _Read_ or _Automate_ mode gives your Workload Factory account the permissions needed to create and manage FSx for ONTAP file systems and to deploy and manage specific workloads, such as databases.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
This step is optional. You don't need to use links to get started with Workload Factory, but you can create a link to unlock all Workload Factory features and capabilities for your FSx for ONTAP file systems. A link creates trust relationship and connectivity between Workload Factory, your AWS account, and your FSx for ONTAP file system. Links currently leverage AWS Lambda.

Get started with Workload Factory by signing up and creating an account, adding credentials so that Workload Factory can manage AWS resources directly, and then optimize your workloads by using Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP.

Workload Factory is accessible to users as a cloud service from the web-based console. Before you get started, you should have an understanding of link:workload-factory-overview.html[Workload Factory] and  link:operational-modes.html[operational modes].

This step is optional. You can use Workload Factory in _Basic_ mode without adding credentials to access your AWS account. Adding AWS credentials to Workload Factory in either _read-only_ mode or _read/write_ mode gives your Workload Factory account the permissions needed to create and manage FSx for ONTAP file systems and to deploy and manage specific workloads, such as databases and GenAI.

Workload Factory is accessible from a web-based console. When you get started with Workload Factory, your first step is to sign up using your existing NetApp Support Site credentials or by creating a NetApp cloud login.

.About this task

You can sign up to Workload Factory using one of the following options:

* Your existing NetApp Support Site (NSS) credentials

* A NetApp cloud login by specifying your email address and a password

.Steps

. Open a web browser and go to the https://console.workloads.netapp.com[Workload Factory console^]

. If you have a NetApp Support Site account, enter the email address associated with your NSS account directly on the *Log in* page.

You can skip the sign up page if you have an NSS account. Workload Factory will sign you up as part of this initial login.

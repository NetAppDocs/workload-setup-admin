Add and manage AWS credentials so that Workload Factory has the permissions that it needs to deploy and manage cloud resources in your AWS accounts. 

== Overview

Workload Factory will operate in Basic mode unless you add AWS account credentials. You can add credentials to enable other operation modes, such as Read mode and Automate mode. link:operational-modes.html[See Operational Modes for details].

You can add AWS credentials to an existing Workload Factory account from the Credentials page. This provides Workload Factory with the permissions needed to manage resources and processes within your AWS cloud environment.

You can add credentials using two methods:

* Manually - You create the IAM policy and the IAM role in your AWS account while adding credentials in Workload Factory. 
* Automatically - You capture a minimal amount of information about permissions and then use a CloudFormation stack to create the IAM policies and role for your credentials.

== Add credentials to an account manually

You can add AWS credentials to Workload Factory manually to give your Workload Factory account the permissions needed to manage the AWS resources that you'll use to run your unique workloads. Each set of credentials that you add will include one or more IAM policies based on the workload capabilities you want to use, and an IAM role that is assigned to your account.

There are three parts to creating the credentials:

* Select the Workload Factory capabilities that you want to use; for example, FSx for ONTAP file system storage, database workloads, AI workloads, and more.
* Create the IAM policies (with the appropriate permissions) for those capabilities in the AWS Management Console.
* Create the IAM role in the AWS Management Console.

.Prerequisites

* You'll need to have credentials to log in to your AWS account.
* something else...

.Steps

. In the Workload Factory console, select the *Account Settings* icon, and select *Credentials*.

. On the *Credentials* page, click *Add credentials* and the Add credentials page is displayed.

. Select *Add manually* and fill out the three sections under _Permissions configuration_.

=== Select the workload capabilities and create the IAM policies

In this section you'll choose which types of workload capabilities will be manageable as part of these credentials, and the permissions enabled for each workload. You'll need to copy the policy permissions for each selected workload from the Codebox and add them into the AWS Management Console within your AWS account to create the policies.

.Steps

. Enable each of the workload capabilities that you want to include in these credentials.
+
You can add additional capabilities later, so just select the workloads that you currently want to deploy and manage.

. For those workload capabilities that offer a choice of permission levels (operate, view, and so on), select the type of permissions that will be available with these credentials.

. In the Codebox window, copy the permissions for the first IAM policy.

. Open another browser window and log in to your AWS account in the AWS Management Console.

. Open the IAM service, and then select *Policies* > *Create Policy*.

. Select JSON as the file type, paste the permissions you copied in step 3, and click *Next*.

. Enter the name for the policy and click *Create Policy*.

. If you've selected multiple workload capabilities in step 1, follow steps 3 - 7  to create a policy for each set of workload permissions.

=== Create the IAM role that uses the policies

In this section you'll set up an IAM role that Workload Factory will assume that includes the permissions and policies that you just created.

.Steps

. In the AWS Management Console, select *Roles > Create Role*.

. Under *Trusted entity type*, select *AWS account*.

.. Select *Another AWS account* and copy/paste the account ID for FSx for ONTAP workload management from the Workload Factory UI.
.. Select *Required external ID* and copy/paste the external ID from the Workload Factory UI.

. Click *Next*.

. In the Permissions policy section, choose all the policies that you defined previously and click *Next*.

. Enter a name for the role and click *Create role*.

. Copy the Role ARN and then return to the Workload Factory UI and paste the ARN in the _Role ARN_ field.

=== Enter the name and add the credentials

. Enter the name that you want to use for these credentials.

. Click *Add* to create the credentials.

.Result

The credentials are created and you are returned to the Credentials page.

== Add credentials to an account using CloudFormation

You can add AWS credentials to Workload Factory using an AWS CloudFormation stack by selecting the Workload Factory capabilities that you want to use, and then launching the AWS CloudFormation stack in your AWS account. CloudFormation will create the IAM policies and IAM role based on the workload capabilities you selected.

.Prerequisites

* You'll need to have credentials to log in to your AWS account.
* You'll need to have the following user permissions when adding credentials using a CloudFormation stack:
+
[source,json]
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "cloudformation:CreateStack",
                "cloudformation:UpdateStack",
                "cloudformation:DeleteStack",
                "cloudformation:DescribeStacks",
                "cloudformation:DescribeStackEvents",
                "cloudformation:DescribeChangeSet",
                "cloudformation:ExecuteChangeSet",
                "cloudformation:ListStacks",
                "cloudformation:ListStackResources",
                "cloudformation:GetTemplate",
                "cloudformation:ValidateTemplate",
                "lambda:InvokeFunction",
                "iam:PassRole",
                "iam:CreateRole",
                "iam:UpdateAssumeRolePolicy",
                "iam:AttachRolePolicy",
                "iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

.Steps

. In the Workload Factory console, select the *Account Settings* icon, and select *Credentials*.
+

. On the *Credentials* page, click *Add credentials* and the Add credentials page is displayed.

. Select *Add via AWS CloudFormation* and fill out the two sections under Permissions configuration.

=== Select the workload capabilities for the IAM policies

In this section you can choose which types of workload capabilities will be manageable as part of these credentials.

.Steps

. Enable each of the workload capabilities that you want to include in these credentials.

. For those workload capabilities that offer a choice of permission levels (operate, view, and so on), select the type of permissions that will be available with these credentials.

. Enter the name that you want to use for these credentials.

. Click *Add* (or click *Redirect to CloudFormation*) and the Redirect to CloudFormation page is displayed.
+
image:screenshot-redirect-cloudformation.png[A screenshot showing how to create the CloudFormation stack for adding policies and a role for Workload Factory credentials.]

. Open another browser window and log in to the AWS Management Console.

. Click *Continue* from the Redirect to CloudFormation page.

. Log in to the AWS account where you plan to use these credentials.

. On the Quick create stack page, under Capabilities, click *I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources*.

. Click *Create stack*.

. Return to Workload Factory and monitor to Credentials page to verify that the new credentials are in progress, or that they have been added.

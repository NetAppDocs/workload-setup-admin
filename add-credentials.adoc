[.lead]
Add and manage AWS credentials so that NetApp Workload Factory has the permissions that it needs to deploy and manage cloud resources in your AWS accounts. 

== Overview

You can add AWS credentials to an existing Workload Factory account from the Credentials page. This provides Workload Factory with the permissions needed to manage resources and processes within your AWS cloud environment.

You can add credentials using two methods:

* *Manually*: You create the IAM policy and the IAM role in your AWS account while adding credentials in Workload Factory. 
* *Automatically*: You capture a minimal amount of information about permissions and then use a CloudFormation stack to create the IAM policies and role for your credentials.

== AWS credentials

We have designed an AWS assume role credentials registration flow that: 

* Supports more aligned AWS account permissions by allowing you to specify the workload capabilities that you want to use and providing IAM policy requirements according to those selections.  
* Allows you to adjust the granted AWS account permissions as you opt-in or opt-out of specific workload capabilities. 
* Simplifies manual IAM policy creation by providing tailored JSON policy files that you can apply in the AWS console.
* Further simplifies the credentials registration process by offering users with an automated option for required IAM policy and role creation using AWS CloudFormation stacks.
* Aligns better with FSx for ONTAP users who strongly prefer to have their credentials stored within the boundaries of the AWS cloud ecosystem by allowing storage of the FSx for ONTAP services credentials in an AWS-based secret management backend.

=== One or more AWS credentials

When you use your first Workload Factory capability (or capabilities), you'll need to create the credentials using the permissions required for those workload capabilities. You'll add the credentials to Workload Factory, but you'll need to access the AWS Management Console to create the IAM role and policy. These credentials will be available within your account when using any capability in Workload Factory.

Your initial set of AWS credentials can include an IAM permissions policy for one capability or for many capabilities. It just depends on your business requirements.

Adding more than one set of AWS credentials to Workload Factory provides additional permissions needed to use additional capabilities, such as FSx for ONTAP file systems, deploy databases on FSx for ONTAP, migrate VMware workloads, and more.

== Add credentials to an account manually

You can add AWS credentials to Workload Factory manually to give your Workload Factory account the permissions needed to manage the AWS resources that you'll use to run your unique workloads. Each set of credentials that you add will include one or more IAM policies based on the workload capabilities you want to use, and an IAM role that is assigned to your account.

NOTE: You can add AWS credentials to an account either from the Workload Factory console or from the NetApp console.

There are three parts to creating the credentials:

* Select the services and permissions level that you would like to use and then create IAM policies from the AWS Management Console.
* Create an IAM role from the AWS Management Console.
* From Workload Factory, enter a name and add the credentials.

.Before you begin

You'll need to have credentials to log in to your AWS account.

.Steps

. Log in to the https://console.workloads.netapp.com/[Workload Factory console^].
. From the menu, select *Administration* and then *Credentials*.
. On the Credentials page, select *Add credentials*.
. On the Add credentials page, select *Add manually* and then use the following steps to complete each section under _Permissions configuration_.
+
image:screenshot-add-credentials-manually.png[A screenshot showing the items that you need to define manually for each set of credentials.]

=== Step 1: Select the workload capabilities and create the IAM policies

In this section you'll choose which types of workload capabilities will be manageable as part of these credentials, and the permissions enabled for each workload. You'll need to copy the policy permissions for each selected workload from the Codebox and add them into the AWS Management Console within your AWS account to create the policies.

.Steps

. From the *Create policies* section, enable each of the workload capabilities that you want to include in these credentials.
+
You can add additional capabilities later, so just select the workloads that you currently want to deploy and manage.

. For those workload capabilities that offer a choice of permission levels (read-only or read/write), select the type of permissions that will be available with these credentials.

. Optional: Select *Enable automatic permissions check* to check if you have the required AWS account permissions to complete workload operations. Enabling the check adds the `iam:SimulatePrincipalPolicy permission` to your permission policies. The purpose of this permission is to confirm permissions only. You can remove the permission after adding credentials, but we recommend keeping it to prevent resource creation for partially successful operations and to save you from any required manual resource cleanup. 

. In the Codebox window, copy the permissions for the first IAM policy.

. Open another browser window and log in to your AWS account in the AWS Management Console.

. Open the IAM service, and then select *Policies* > *Create Policy*.

. Select JSON as the file type, paste the permissions you copied in step 3, and select *Next*.

. Enter the name for the policy and select *Create Policy*.

. If you've selected multiple workload capabilities in step 1, repeat these steps to create a policy for each set of workload permissions.

=== Step 2: Create the IAM role that uses the policies

In this section you'll set up an IAM role that Workload Factory will assume that includes the permissions and policies that you just created.

image:screenshot-create-role.png[A screenshot showing which permissions will be part of the new role.]

.Steps

. In the AWS Management Console, select *Roles > Create Role*.

. Under *Trusted entity type*, select *AWS account*.

.. Select *Another AWS account* and copy and paste the account ID for FSx for ONTAP workload management from the Workload Factory UI.
.. Select *Required external ID* and copy and paste the external ID from the Workload Factory UI.

. Select *Next*.

. In the Permissions policy section, choose all the policies that you defined previously and select *Next*.

. Enter a name for the role and select *Create role*.

. Copy the Role ARN.

. Return to the Add Credentials page in Workload Factory, expand the *Create role* section under *Permission configuration*, and paste the ARN in the _Role ARN_ field.

=== Step 3: Enter a name and add the credentials

The final step is to enter a name for the credentials in Workload Factory.

.Steps

. From the Add Credentials page in Workload Factory, expand *Credentials name* under *Permission configuration*.

. Enter the name that you want to use for these credentials.

. Select *Add* to create the credentials.

.Result

The credentials are created and you are returned to the Credentials page.

== Add credentials to an account using CloudFormation

You can add AWS credentials to Workload Factory using an AWS CloudFormation stack by selecting the Workload Factory capabilities that you want to use, and then launching the AWS CloudFormation stack in your AWS account. CloudFormation will create the IAM policies and IAM role based on the workload capabilities you selected.

.Before you begin

* You'll need to have credentials to log in to your AWS account.
* You'll need to have the following permissions in your AWS account when adding credentials using a CloudFormation stack:
+
[source,json]
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "cloudformation:CreateStack",
        "cloudformation:UpdateStack",
        "cloudformation:DeleteStack",
        "cloudformation:DescribeStacks",
        "cloudformation:DescribeStackEvents",
        "cloudformation:DescribeChangeSet",
        "cloudformation:ExecuteChangeSet",
        "cloudformation:ListStacks",
        "cloudformation:ListStackResources",
        "cloudformation:GetTemplate",
        "cloudformation:ValidateTemplate",
        "lambda:InvokeFunction",
        "iam:PassRole",
        "iam:CreateRole",
        "iam:UpdateAssumeRolePolicy",
        "iam:AttachRolePolicy",
        "iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}

.Steps

. Log in to the https://console.workloads.netapp.com/[Workload Factory console^].
. From the menu, select *Administration* and then *Credentials*.
. On the Credentials page, select *Add credentials*.
. Select *Add via AWS CloudFormation*.
+
image:screenshot-add-credentials-cloudformation.png[A screenshot showing the items that need to be defined before you can launch CloudFormation to create the credentials.]

. Under *Create policies*, enable each of the workload capabilities that you want to include in these credentials and choose a permission level for each workload.
+
You can add additional capabilities later, so just select the workloads that you currently want to deploy and manage.

. Optional: Select *Enable automatic permissions check* to check if you have the required AWS account permissions to complete workload operations. Enabling the check adds the `iam:SimulatePrincipalPolicy` permission to your permission policies. The purpose of this permission is to confirm permissions only. You can remove the permission after adding credentials, but we recommend keeping it to prevent resource creation for partially successful operations and to save you from any required manual resource cleanup.  

. Under *Credentials name*, enter the name that you want to use for these credentials.

. Add the credentials from AWS CloudFormation:

.. Select *Add* (or select *Redirect to CloudFormation*) and the Redirect to CloudFormation page is displayed.
+
image:screenshot-redirect-cloudformation.png[A screenshot showing how to create the CloudFormation stack for adding policies and a role for Workload Factory credentials.]

.. If you use single sign-on (SSO) with AWS, open a separate browser tab and log in to the AWS Console before you select *Continue*.
+
You should log in to the AWS account where the FSx for ONTAP file system resides.

.. Select *Continue* from the Redirect to CloudFormation page.

.. On the Quick create stack page, under Capabilities, select *I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources*.

.. Select *Create stack*.

.. Return to Workload Factory and monitor to Credentials page to verify that the new credentials are in progress, or that they have been added.

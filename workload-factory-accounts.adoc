A Workload Factory account enables you to organize resources, workloads, and workload access for your organization using credentials.

When you first access Workload Factory, you're prompted to select or create an account. For example, you'll see the following screen if you don't have an account yet:

//Workload Factory Account Admins can then modify the settings for this account by managing users (members):

//== Operational modes

//Workload Factory offers the following operational modes for your account: basic mode, read mode, and automate mode. These modes support environments that have varying levels of security and connectivity restrictions.

== Members

Members are Workload Factory users that you associate with your Workload Factory account. At this time, you can create only a single Account Admin user for a single account in the Workload Factory user interface. An Account Admin can perform any action in Workload Factory.

Note that Workload Factory uses the BlueXP tenancy model so if your company also uses BlueXP, and you have created multiple users within a single account in BlueXP, those same users will have access to the same account in Workload Factory. It doesn't matter if the BlueXP user was created with the Account Admin, Workspace Admin, or Compliance Viewer role--they will all have Account Admin permissions in Workload Factory.

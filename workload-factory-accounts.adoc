A Workload Factory account enables you to organize resources, workloads, and workload access for your organization using credentials.

When you first access Workload Factory, you're prompted to select or create an account. For example, you'll see the following screen if you don't have an account yet:

//Workload Factory Account Admins can then modify the settings for this account by managing users (members):

== Operational modes

Workload Factory offers the following operational modes for your account: basic mode, read mode, and automate mode. These modes support environments that have varying levels of security and connectivity restrictions.

== Members

Members are Workload Factory users that you associate with your Workload Factory account. At this time you can create only a single Account Admin user for a single account in the Workload Factory user interface. An Account Admin can perform any action in Workload Factory.

Note that Workload Factory uses the BlueXP tenancy model so if your company also uses BlueXP, and you have created multiple users within a single account in BlueXP, those same users will have access to the account in Workload Factory.

//== Examples
//
//The following examples depict how you might set up your accounts.
//
//NOTE: In both example images that follow, the Connector and the Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems don't actually reside _in_ the Workload Factory account--they're running in a cloud provider. This is a conceptual representation of the relationship between each component.
//
//=== Multiple accounts
//
//Here's another example that shows the highest level of multi-tenancy by using two separate Workload Factory accounts. For example, a service provider might use Workload Factory in one account to provide services for their customers, while using another account to provide disaster recovery for one of their business units.
//
//Note that account 2 includes two separate Connectors. This might happen if you have systems in separate regions or in separate cloud providers.

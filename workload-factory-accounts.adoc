A Workload Factory account provides multi-tenancy for your organization, which enables you to organize users, resources, and workload access using credentials.

When you first access Workload Factory, you're prompted to select or create an account. For example, you'll see the following screen if you don't have an account yet:

Workload Factory Account Admins can then modify the settings for this account by managing users (members):

== Operational modes

Workload Factory offers the following operational modes for your account: basic mode, read mode, and automate mode. These modes support environments that have varying levels of security and connectivity restrictions.

== Members

Members are Workload Factory users that you associate with your Workload Factory account. Associating a user with an account and one or more workspaces in that account enables those users to create and manage working environments in Workload Factory.

When you associate a user, you assign them a role:

* _Account Admin_: Can perform any action in Workload Factory.

== Connectivity links

A link creates trust relationship and connectivity between Workload Factory and an AWS account. You don't need a link to get started with Workload Factory, but you'll need to create a link to unlock all Workload Factory features and services.

== Examples

The following examples depict how you might set up your accounts.

NOTE: In both example images that follow, the Connector and the Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems don't actually reside _in_ the Workload Factory account--they're running in a cloud provider. This is a conceptual representation of the relationship between each component.

=== Multiple accounts

Here's another example that shows the highest level of multi-tenancy by using two separate Workload Factory accounts. For example, a service provider might use Workload Factory in one account to provide services for their customers, while using another account to provide disaster recovery for one of their business units.

Note that account 2 includes two separate Connectors. This might happen if you have systems in separate regions or in separate cloud providers.

NetApp Workload Factory is a powerful life-cycle management platform designed to help you optimize your workloads using Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file systems. Workloads that can be streamlined using Workload Factory and FSx for ONTAP include databases, VMware migrations to VMware Cloud on AWS, AI chatbots, and more.

Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP provides fully managed, AWS-native NFS, SMB/CIFS, and iSCSI storage volumes for mission-critical applications, databases, containers, VMware Cloud datastores, and user files. You can manage FSx for ONTAP through Workload Factory and by using native AWS management tools. 

Workload Factory has attained the AWS Well-Architected stamp of approval, and can run entirely on AWS as a dedicated experience.

== Features

The Workload Factory platform provides the following major capabilities.

Flexible and low cost storage:: 
Discover, deploy, and manage Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file systems in the cloud. FSx for ONTAP brings the full capabilities of ONTAP to a native AWS managed service delivering a consistent hybrid cloud experience. 

Migrate on-premises vSphere environments to VMware Cloud on AWS::
The VMware Cloud on AWS onboarding advisor enables you to analyze your current virtual machine configurations in on-premises vSphere environments and generate a plan to deploy recommended VM layouts to VMware Cloud on AWS and use customized Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file systems as external datastores.

Optimized database deployment::
End-to-end templatized deployment of Microsoft SQL server/host including AWS resources provisioning, storage provisioning, networking, and OS configurations, ensuring a consistent and error-free setup process.

AI chatbot development::
Leverage your FSx for ONTAP file systems for storing your organizations chatbot sources and the AI Engine databases. This allows you to embed your organization's unstructured data into an enterprise chatbot application.

Storage calculators to save costs::
Analyze your current deployments that use Amazon EBS or EFS storage, or Amazon FSx for Windows File Server, to see how much money you can save by moving to Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file systems.

== Supported cloud providers

Workload Factory enables you to manage cloud storage and use workload capabilities in Amazon Web Services.

== Cost

Workload Factory itself does not have a cost - the platform is free to use. The cost that you pay to VMware and to Amazon Web Services (AWS) depends on the storage and workload services that you plan to deploy. This includes the cost of Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file systems, VMware Cloud on AWS infrastructure, AWS services, and more.

== How Workload Factory works

Workload Factory includes a web-based console that's provided through the SaaS layer, accounts that provide multi-tenancy, and "links" that provide segregated connectivity between Workload Factory and an AWS account.

=== Software-as-a-service

Workload Factory is accessible through a https://console.workloads.netapp.com[web-based console^] and APIs. This SaaS experience enables you to automatically access the latest features as they're released and to easily switch between your Workload Factory accounts and links.

=== Workload Factory account

When you log in to Workload Factory for the first time, you're prompted to create a _Workload Factory account_. This account provides multi-tenancy and enables you to organize your resources.

=== Connectivity links

You don't need a link to get started with Workload Factory, but you'll need to create a link to unlock all Workload Factory features and services. A link creates trust relationship and connectivity between Workload Factory and an AWS account. Links leverage AWS Lambda.

=== Operational modes 

Workload Factory provides three operational modes that you can assign for users in your AWS accounts to carefully control access to your cloud estate, and assign incremental trust to Workload Factory based on your IT policies.

* *Basic mode* represents zero-trust relationship and is designed for early exploration of Workload Factory and usage of the various wizards to create the needed Infrastructure as Code. This code can be copied and used manually by the user along with their relevant AWS credentials.  

* *Read mode* enhances the experience of Basic mode by assisting the user in detecting various resources and tools, and consequently, helping to complete relevant wizards. 

* *Automate mode* represents a full trust relationship and is designed to execute and automate on behalf of the user along with the assigned credentials that have the needed and validated permissions for execution.

=== Codebox automation

Codebox is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) co-pilot that helps developers and DevOps generate the code needed to execute any operation supported by Workload Factory. Code formats include Workload Factory REST APIs, AWS CLI, and AWS CloudFormation at this time.

Codebox is aligned with the Workload Factory operation modes (Basic, Read, Automate) and sets a clear path for execution readiness as well as an automation catalog for quick future reuse. 

The Codebox Viewer pane shows the IaC that is generated by a specific job flow operation, and is matched by a graphical wizard or conversational chat interface. While Codebox Viewer supports color coding and search for easy navigation and analysis, it does not allow editing - only copying or saving to the Automation Catalog.

=== REST APIs

Workload Factory enables you to optimize, automate, and operate your FSx for ONTAP file systems for specific workloads. Each workload exposes an associated REST API. Collectively, these workloads and APIs form a flexible and extensible development platform you can use to administer your FSx for ONTAP file systems. 

There are several benefits when using the Workload Factory REST APIs:

* The APIs have been designed based on REST technology and current best practices. The core technologies include HTTP and JSON.

* Workload Factory authentication is based on the OAuth2 standard. NetApp relies on the Auth0 service implementation.

* The Workload Factory web UI uses the same core REST APIs and so there is consistency between the two access paths.

== SOC 2 Type 2 certification

An independent certified public accountant firm and services auditor examined Workload Factory and affirmed that it achieved SOC 2 Type 2 reports based on the applicable Trust Services criteria.

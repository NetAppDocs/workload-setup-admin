Get started with Workload Factory in standard mode by preparing networking for the Workload Factory console, signing up and creating an account, optionally creating a Connector, and subscribing to Workload Factory.

In standard mode, Workload Factory is accessible to users as a cloud service from the web-based console. Before you get started, you should have an understanding of link:concept-netapp-accounts.html[Workload Factory accounts], link:concept-connectors.html[Connectors], and link:concept-modes.html[deployment modes].

Computers that access the Workload Factory console should have connections to specific endpoints to complete a few administrative tasks. If your network restricts outbound access, you should ensure that these endpoints are allowed.

Go to the https://console.workload.netapp.com[Workload Factory console^] and sign up. You'll be given the option to create an account, but you can skip that step if you're being invited to an existing account.

At this point, you're logged in and can start using several Workload Factory services like Digital Advisor, Amazon FSx for ONTAP, Azure NetApp Files, and more. link:concept-connectors.html[Learn what you can do without a Connector].

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You don't need a Connector to get started with Workload Factory, but you can create a Connector to unlock all Workload Factory features and services. The Connector is NetApp software that enables Workload Factory to manage resources and processes within your hybrid cloud environment.

A Workload Factory Account Admin can create a Connector in your cloud or on-premises network.

Note that if you want to use Workload Factory services to manage storage and data in Google Cloud, then the Connector must be running in Google Cloud.

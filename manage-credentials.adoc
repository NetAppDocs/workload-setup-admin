Add and manage AWS credentials so that Workload Factory has the permissions that it needs to deploy and manage cloud resources in your AWS accounts. If you manage multiple AWS Marketplace subscriptions, you can assign each one of them to different AWS credentials from the Credentials page.

== Overview

You can add AWS credentials to Workload Factory from the Credentials page :

* Add additional AWS credentials to an existing Connector
+
Adding AWS credentials to an existing Connector provides the permissions needed to manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment. <<Add additional credentials to a Connector,Learn how to add AWS credentials to a Connector>>.

* Add AWS credentials to BlueXP for FSx for ONTAP
+
Adding new AWS credentials to BlueXP gives BlueXP the permissions needed to create and manage FSx for ONTAP. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-fsx-ontap/requirements/task-setting-up-permissions-fsx.html[Learn how to set up permissions for FSx for ONTAP^]

== How to rotate credentials

BlueXP enables you to provide AWS credentials in a few ways: an IAM role associated with the Connector instance, by assuming an IAM role in a trusted account, or by providing AWS access keys. link:concept-accounts-aws.html[Learn more about AWS credentials and permissions].

With the first two options, BlueXP uses the AWS Security Token Service to obtain temporary credentials that rotate constantly. This process is the best practice because it's automatic and it's secure.

If you provide BlueXP with AWS access keys, you should rotate the keys by updating them in BlueXP at a regular interval. This is a completely manual process.

== Add additional credentials to a Connector

Add additional AWS credentials to a Connector so that it has the permissions needed to manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment. You can either provide the ARN of an IAM role in another account or provide AWS access keys.

If you're just getting started with BlueXP, link:credentials-overview.html[Learn how BlueXP uses AWS credentials and permissions].

=== Grant permissions

Before you add AWS credentials to a Connector, you need to provide the required permissions. The permissions enable BlueXP to manage resources and processes within that AWS account. How you provide the permissions depends on whether you want to provide BlueXP with the ARN of a role in a trusted account or AWS keys.

NOTE: If you deployed a Connector from BlueXP, BlueXP automatically added AWS credentials for the account in which you deployed the Connector. This initial account is not added if you deployed the Connector from the AWS Marketplace or if you manually installed the Connector software on an existing system. link:concept-accounts-aws.html[Learn about AWS credentials and permissions].

*Choices*

* <<Grant permissions by assuming an IAM role in another account>>
* <<Grant permissions by providing AWS keys>>

==== Grant permissions by assuming an IAM role in another account

You can set up a trust relationship between the source AWS account in which you deployed the Connector instance and other AWS accounts by using IAM roles. You would then provide BlueXP with the ARN of the IAM roles from the trusted accounts.

If the Connector is installed on premises, you can't use this authentication method. You must use AWS keys.

.Steps

. Go to the IAM console in the target account in which you want to provide the Connector with permissions.

. Under Access Management, select *Roles > Create Role* and follow the steps to create the role.
+
Be sure to do the following:

* Under *Trusted entity type*, select *AWS account*.
* Select *Another AWS account* and enter the ID of the account where the Connector instance resides.
* Create the required policies by copying and pasting the contents of link:reference-permissions-aws.html[the IAM policies for the Connector].

. Copy the Role ARN of the IAM role so that you can paste it in BlueXP later on.

.Result

The account now has the required permissions. <<add-the-credentials,You can now add the credentials to a Connector>>.

==== Grant permissions by providing AWS keys

If you want to provide BlueXP with AWS keys for an IAM user, then you need to grant the required permissions to that user. The BlueXP IAM policy defines the AWS actions and resources that BlueXP is allowed to use.

You must use this authentication method if the Connector is installed on premises. You can't use an IAM role.

.Steps

. From the IAM console, create policies by copying and pasting the contents of link:reference-permissions-aws.html[the IAM policies for the Connector].
+
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html[AWS Documentation: Creating IAM Policies^]

. Attach the policies to an IAM role or an IAM user.
+
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create.html[AWS Documentation: Creating IAM Roles^]
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-attach-detach.html[AWS Documentation: Adding and Removing IAM Policies^]

.Result

The account now has the required permissions. <<add-the-credentials,You can now add the credentials to a Connector>>.

=== Add the credentials

After you provide an AWS account with the required permissions, you can add the credentials for that account to an existing Connector. This enables you to launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in that account using the same Connector.

.Before you begin

If you just created these credentials in your cloud provider, it might take a few minutes until they are available for use. Wait a few minutes before you add the credentials to BlueXP.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the Workload Factory console, select the *Account Settings* icon, and select *Credentials*.
+
image:screenshot_settings_icon.gif[A screenshot that shows the Settings icon in the upper right of the BlueXP console.]

. On the *Credentials* page, click *Add Credentials* and follow the steps in the wizard.

.. *Credentials Location*: Select *Amazon Web Services > Connector*.

.. *Define Credentials*: Provide the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of a trusted IAM role, or enter an AWS access key and secret key.

.. *Marketplace Subscription*: Associate a Marketplace subscription with these credentials by subscribing now or by selecting an existing subscription.
+
To pay for BlueXP services at an hourly rate (PAYGO) or with an annual contract, AWS credentials must be associated with an AWS Marketplace subscription.

.. *Review*: Confirm the details about the new credentials and select *Add*.

.Result

You can now switch to a different set of credentials from the Details and Credentials page when creating a new working environment:

== Add credentials to Workload Factory to manage AWS resources

You can add AWS credentials to Workload Factory by providing the ARN of an IAM role that gives Workload Factory the permissions needed to manage the resources needed to run your unique workloads. 

.Prerequisites

* You'll need to have credentials for your AWS account.
* something else...

.Steps

. In the Workload Factory console, select the *Account Settings* icon, and select *Credentials*.
+
image:screenshot-settings-icon.png[A screenshot that shows the Account Settings icon in the Workload Factory console.]

. On the *Credentials* page, click *Add credentials* and the Add credentials page is displayed.

. You can choose to add credential manually or by launching a CloudFormation stack.

Click *Add manually" and fill out three sections under Permissions configuration.

image:screenshot-add-permissions-manually.png[A screenshot showing the items that need to be defined manually for each set of credentials.]

=== Create the IAM policies

In this section you can choose which types of workload capabilities will be manageable as part of these credentials, and the permissions enabled for each workload. You'll need to copy the policy permissions for each workload from the Codebox and add them into the AWS Management Console within your account.

image:screenshot-create-policies.png[A screenshot showing which types of workload capabilities will be manageable as part of these credentials.]

.Steps

. Enable each of the workload capabilities that will be included in these credentials.

. For those workload capabilities that offer a variety of permissions (operate, view, etc.), select the types of permissions that will be available with these credentials.

. Open another browser instance and follow the steps outlined in the UI to add the the policies for each selected workload capability to the policy page in the AWS Management Console.

=== Create the IAM role

In this section you can choose which types of workload capabilities will be manageable as part of these credentials, and the permissions enabled for each workload. You'll need to copy the policy permissions for each workload from the Codebox and add them into the AWS Management Console within your account.

image:screenshot-create-policies.png[A screenshot showing which types of workload capabilities will be manageable as part of these credentials.]

Set up an IAM role that enables Workload Factory to assume the role.

.Steps

. Go to the IAM console in the target account.

. Under Access Management, select *Roles > Create Role* and follow the steps to create the role.
+
Be sure to do the following:

* Under *Trusted entity type*, select *AWS account*.
* Select *Another AWS account* and enter the ID of the Workload Factory SaaS: 933004784675
* Create a policy that includes the permissions required to create a Connector.

. Copy the Role ARN of the IAM role so that you can paste it in BlueXP in the next step.

.Result

The IAM role now has the required permissions. <<add-the-credentials-2,You can now add it to BlueXP>>.

=== Add the credentials

After you provide the IAM role with the required permissions, add the role ARN to Workload Factory.

.Before you begin

If you just created the IAM role, it might take a few minutes until they are available for use. Wait a few minutes before you add the credentials to Workload Factory.

.Steps

. In the Workload Factory console, select the *Account Settings* icon, and select *Credentials*.
+
image:screenshot-settings-icon.png[A screenshot that shows the Settings icon in the upper right of the Workload Factory console.]

. On the *Credentials* page, click *Add credentials* and follow the steps in the wizard.

.. *Credentials Location*: Select *Amazon Web Services > BlueXP*.

.. *Define Credentials*: Provide the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the IAM role.

.. *Review*: Confirm the details about the new credentials and select *Add*.

.Result

You can now use the credentials when creating a new Connector.

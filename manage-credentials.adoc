You can manage the AWS credentials that are integrated with Workload Factory when you want to change how Workload Factory accesses your AWS accounts. 

== Overview

Workload Factory operates in Basic mode unless you add AWS account credentials. You can add credentials to enable other operation modes, such as Read mode and Automate mode. link:operational-modes.html[See Operational Modes for details].

//== Edit credentials
//
//Edit your AWS credentials in Workload Factory by changing by editing the name, or by updating the credentials themselves (the role ARN).
//
//.Steps
//
//. In the Workload Factory console, select the *Account Settings* icon, and select *Credentials*.
//
//. On the *Credentials* page, select the action menu for a set of credentials and then select *Edit Credentials*.
//
//. Make the required changes and then select *Apply*.

== Remove credentials

If you no longer need a set of credentials, you can delete them from Workload Factory. You can only delete credentials that aren't associated with an FSx for ONTAP system.

.Steps

. In the Workload Factory console, select the *Account Settings* icon, and select *Credentials*.

. On the *Credentials* page, select the action menu for a set of credentials and then select *Remove*.

. Select *Remove* to confirm.

== Add additional credentials to an account
 
You can add additional AWS credentials to an account so that it has the permissions needed to manage resources and processes within your AWS cloud environment. You can either provide the ARN of an IAM role in another account.
 
=== Grant permissions
 
Before you add AWS credentials to an account, you need to provide the required permissions. The permissions enable Workload Factory to manage resources and processes within that AWS account.
 
You can set up a trust relationship between the source AWS account and other AWS accounts by using IAM roles. You would then provide Workload Factory with the ARN of the IAM roles from the trusted accounts.

.Steps

. Go to the IAM console in the target account in which you want to provide Workload Factory with permissions.

. Under Access Management, select *Roles > Create Role* and follow the steps to create the role.
+
Be sure to do the following:

* Under *Trusted entity type*, select *AWS account*.
* Select *Another AWS account* and enter the ID of the account where the Connector instance resides.
* Create the required policies by copying and pasting the contents of link:reference-permissions-aws.html[the IAM policies for the Connector].

. Copy the Role ARN of the IAM role so that you can paste it in Workload Factory later on.

.Result

The account now has the required permissions.

=== Add the credentials

After you provide the IAM role with the required permissions, add the role ARN to Workload Factory.

.Before you begin

If you just created the IAM role, it might take a few minutes until they are available for use. Wait a few minutes before you add the credentials to Workload Factory.

.Steps

. In the Workload Factory console, select the *Account Settings* icon, and select *Credentials*.

. On the *Credentials* page, click *Add credentials* and follow the steps in the wizard.

.. *Credentials Location*: Select *Amazon Web Services > BlueXP*.

.. *Define Credentials*: Provide the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the IAM role.

.. *Review*: Confirm the details about the new credentials and select *Add*.

.Result

You can now use the credentials when creating a new Connector.

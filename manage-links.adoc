You can create and manage links to provide a trust relationship and connectivity between a Workload Factory account and one or more FSx for ONTAP file systems. This enables you to monitor and manage certain features directly from the ONTAP file system that are not available through the AWS FSx for ONTAP APIs. 

See link:connectivity-links.html[Connectivity links] for details about when a link is and is not needed.

Links leverage AWS Lambda to execute code in response to events and automatically manage the computing resources required by that code. The links that you create are part of your NetApp account and they are associated with an AWS account.

== View the links associated with your account

You can view the links that are currently associated with your account. 

. From the Account menu, select *Links*.

. If any links exist, the overview page provides the information.
+

. To view the FSx for ONTAP file systems that are associated with a link, click the *View* button in the Associated resources section.
+

. If you need the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the link, you can click the _copy_ icon next to the ARN field. 

== Create a link

You can create a link in your account when defining an FSx for ONTAP file system. That link will be used for that file system, and it can be used by other FSx for ONTAP file systems.

You'll need to launch an AWS CloudFormation stack in your AWS account to create the link.

.Prerequisites

* You'll need to have credentials to log in to your AWS account.
* You'll need to have the following permissions in your AWS account when adding a link using a CloudFormation stack:

.Steps

. Click *Associate link* from the FSx for ONTAP wizard.

. Click the *Create link* button.

. Enter the name that you want to use for this link. The name must be unique within your account.

. Optionally, add any tags that you want to be associated with this link so you can more easily categorize your resources. For example, you could add a tag that identifies this link as being used by FSx for ONTAP systems.
+
The AWS account and the additional information for Account, Location, and Security group are retrieved automatically based on the FSx for ONTAP system.

. Click *Redirect to CloudFormation*.
+
The dialog that explains how to create the link from the AWS CloudFormation service is displayed.

. Click *Continue* to open the AWS Management Console, and then log in to the AWS account for this FSx for ONTAP system.

. On the Quick create stack page, under Capabilities, select *I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources*.

. Click *Create stack* and then click *Continue*.
+
You can monitor the link create status from the Events page.

. Return to the Workload Factory interface and you'll see that the link is associated with the FSx for ONTAP system.

.Result

The link you created is associated with the FSx for ONTAP system and you can perform some advanced ONTAP operations.

== Edit a link

You can't edit a link from the Workload Factory interface. If you need to make a change to a link, you'll need to create a new link and then associate that link to your file system.

NOTE: You can edit the Lambda network configuration (for example VPC, subnets, and security groups) using the AWS console and the changes will be reflected in links management UI, however these changes can lead to connectivity issues between the Lambda and ONTAP and are not recommended. 

== Associate a link to an FSx for ONTAP file system

After you have created a link, you can associate it with your FSx for ONTAP file systems. Each file system can be associated to only one link, but a link can be associated with many file systems. 

.Steps

. Click *Associate link* from the Storage page of an FSx for ONTAP system.

. In the Associate link page, click the *Associate an existing link* button.

. Select the link that you want to use from the menu and click *Apply*.

.Result

The link is associated with the FSx for ONTAP system and you can perform advanced ONTAP operations.

== Remove a link

You can remove a link that you're no longer using in your environment. Any FSx for ONTAP systems or other resources that were using te link will be unable to use certain functionality after the link is removed.

Note that the link is only deleted from Workload Factory - it is not deleted from your AWS environment. You must delete the Lambda function from your AWS account after removing the link.

.Steps

. From the Links page, click the menu button and click *Remove*.

. If you are sure, click *Remove* again.

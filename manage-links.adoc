You can create and manage links to provide a trust relationship and connectivity between a Workload Factory account and an AWS account. 

You don't need a link for all Workload Factory operations, but you'll need to create one and associate it with your FSx for ONTAP file systems or other resources to enable all Workload Factory features and workload capabilities. 

Links leverage AWS Lambda to execute code in response to events and automatically manage the computing resources required by that code. The links that you create are part of your NetApp account and they are associated with an AWS account.

== View the links associated with your account and resources

== Associate a link to a resource

After you have created a link you can associate it with your FSx for ONTAP file systems. Each file system or resource can be associated only to one link, but a link can be associated with many file systems or resources. If necessary, you can disassociate a resource from a link.

== Disassociate a link 



== Delete a link

If you need to delete a link, it is deleted only from Workload Factory. You must delete the Lambda from your AWS account.

You can create and manage links to provide a trust relationship and connectivity between a Workload Factory account and an AWS account. 

You don't need a link for all Workload Factory operations, but you'll need to create one and associate it with your FSx for ONTAP file systems or other resources to enable all Workload Factory features and workload capabilities. 

Links leverage AWS Lambda to execute code in response to events and automatically manage the computing resources required by that code. The links that you create are part of your NetApp account and they are associated with an AWS account.

== View the links associated with your account and the associated resources

You can view the links that are currently associated with your account. 

. Select *Links* from the Account menu.

. If any links exist, the overview page provides the information.

. To view the FSx for ONTAP file systems or other resources that are using a link, click the *View* button in the Associated resources section.

. If you need the Amazon Resource Names (ARN) for the link, you can click the _copy_ icon next to the ARN. 

== Create a link

You can create a link from your account or you can create one when defining an FSx for ONTAP file system.

The only difference between the two methods is that:

* When you create a link while defining an FSx for ONTAP system, the AWS account used for the link is the same as the account you're using to create the FSx for ONTAP system.
* When you create a link from the Account menu, you can choose the AWS account that will be used for the link.

.Create a link from the Account menu
--
.Steps

. Select *Links* from the Account menu.

. Click the *Create link* button and the Create link page is displayed.

. Enter the name that you want to use for this link. The name must be unique within your account.
. Optionally, add any tags that you want to be associated with the resources allocated for this link, for example, an FSx for ONTAP system.
. If you have added multiple AWS account credentials in your Workload Factory account, select the AWS account where the AWS Lambda service will be created.
+
The additional information for Location and Security group are retrieved automatically based on the AWS account you select.
. Click *Redirect to CloudFormation*.
+
The dialog that explains how to create the link from the AWS CloudFormation service is displayed.
. On the Quick create stack page, under Capabilities, select *I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources*.
. Click *Create stack* and then click *Continue*.
. Return to the Workload Factory interface and you'll see a dialog showing the progress of the link creation.
+
A message displays when the link is complete.

.Result

The link is created. You can associate it with your FSx for ONTAP file systems.

.Create a link from the FSx for ONTAP wizard
--
.Steps

. Click *Associate link* from the FSx for ONTAP wizard.

. Click the *Create link* button.

. Enter the name that you want to use for this link. The name must be unique within your account.
. Optionally, add any tags that you want to be associated with the resources allocated for this link, for example, the FSx for ONTAP system.
+
The AWS account and the additional information for Location and Security group are retrieved automatically based on the AWS account where you are creating the FSx for ONTAP system.
. Click *Redirect to CloudFormation*.
+
The dialog that explains how to create the link from the AWS CloudFormation service is displayed.
. Click *Continue* to open the AWS Management Console, and then log in to the AWS account for this FSx for ONTAP system.
. On the Quick create stack page, under Capabilities, select *I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources*.
. Click *Create stack* and then click *Continue*.
. Return to the Workload Factory interface and you'll see a dialog showing the progress of the link creation.
+
A message displays when the link is complete.

.Result

The link you created is associated with the FSx for ONTAP system.  
====

== Edit a link

Can you edit any values?  Like add or remove tags?

== Associate a link to a resource

After you have created a link you can associate it with your FSx for ONTAP file systems. Each file system or resource can be associated only to one link, but a link can be associated with many file systems or resources. If necessary, you can disassociate a resource from a link.

== Disassociate a link 

You can disassociate a link from a resource...

== Remove a link

You can remove a link that you're no longer using in your environment. Any FSx for ONTAP systems or other resources that were using te link will be unable to use certain functionality after the link is removed.

Note that the link is only deleted from Workload Factory - it is not deleted from your AWS environment. You must delete the Lambda function from your AWS account after removing the link.

.Steps

. From the Links page, click the menu button and click *Remove*.

. If you are sure, click *Remove* again.
